# Issafalcon Neovim Configuration

## ðŸš€ Highlights

- Modular Neovim Configuration
- API convenience functions (many of which are courtesy of the AstroNvim codebase) under the `api` folder
- Core Neovim Configuration in the `core` folder
- LSP area with self contained API and LSP-Server configurations
- Plugin modules loaded with [Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for optimized lazy loaded plugins 

## Modules

All plugins are installed and configured via the `modules` folders. Each one contains a `spec.lua` file which brings together all the plugin specs for `Lazy.nvim` to load. 

All modules and their plugins are registered in the `init.lua` root file, so modules and plugins can be disabled by removing / commenting out from the registration function.

### Plugins

- Module containing all the supporting plugins for Neovim plugin development, or other plugins required as a dependency by multiple other plugins
- `plenary` is currently the only plugin installed as a default with this module. Others are explicitly registered

### Editing
### Cheatsheets

- Contains plugins to enable keymaps and commands to be added to cheatsheets like `Legendary` 
- Currently essential to keep in as mappigns cannot be created without the plugins in this module (except `cheatsheet`)

- Provide smarter way for reloading neovim configuration without leaving neovim
- Create toggle commands for certain neovim / plugin functionality
